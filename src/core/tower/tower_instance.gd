class_name TowerInstance
extends Node2D

## Minimal visual presentation for a placed tower. Displays a static texture
## keyed by the tower's Foundation archetype (`physical` | `ranged` |
## `elemental` | `support`, per design/gdd/tower.md Group 2).
##
## Scope note: this is presentation only — it has no link yet to
## TowerSystem/TowerMissionState (which remain RefCounted, headless
## simulation with no scene-tree presence). Placement-triggered
## instantiation, tier-based art swaps, and damaged-state visuals are not
## yet designed; call configure() manually until that wiring exists.

## Archetype -> art lookup. All 4 archetypes now have placeholder art.

## Target on-screen height (world units, matches MonsterManager.CELL_SIZE=64
## so a tower reads as roughly one grid cell). Source art is unscaled,
## native ChatGPT-generation resolution and varies wildly by archetype
## (267x471 to 1185x1173, per a project-wide art-asset sweep 2026-08-03) --
## found and fixed proactively here, mirroring the identical unscaled-sprite
## bug already found live (via Godot MCP) and fixed in MonsterInstance and
## diorama.gd's structure sprites. TowerInstance has no live placement
## call-site yet to have caught this by screenshot the same way -- fixed
## ahead of that wiring so it isn't rediscovered the hard way later.

## design/gdd/tower.md IDLE Visual/Audio Requirements: "Elemental towers may

## particles." Only these 2 elements are named by the GDD — poison/lightning/
## arcane have no idle-ambient signature specified, so they get none (not an
## oversight; nothing to add without inventing an unspecified signature).
## Deliberately much lower amount/velocity than ProjectileVisual's own
## per-shot trail configs — this must read as "quietly present," not compete
## with TARGETING/ATTACKING visuals per the GDD's own distinctness mandate.

## acquired target... A low-intensity glow on the weapon slot signals
## 'locked and counting down.'" Scope note: this project's actual TowerSystem
## logic (Rule 17) only resolves a target at attack-timer expiry, immediately
## transitioning to ATTACKING in the same instant — there is no separate,
## sustained "target acquired, timer still counting down" backend state to
## visualize continuously. This is approximated the only way the real game
## logic allows: both the orientation snap and the glow start fire from the
## same tower_attacked event ATTACKING itself fires from (see
## play_attack_punch()), with the glow's fade duration set to the tower's own
## next attack-cycle length (1.0 / attack_speed) so it reads as "counting
## down to the next shot" even though it technically starts at the previous
## shot's moment rather than proactively at true acquisition time.

## design/gdd/tower.md "Tower ATTACKING State": "Attack animation on fire
## (recoil, beam flash, energy discharge, or AoE effect by weapon type)...
## Must be visually distinct from TARGETING." Kept on separate visual
## channels from the TARGETING glow above (sprite modulate/scale here vs. a
## dedicated glow dot there) specifically so the two can never visually
## merge into one indistinguishable effect. A single unified "punch" (flash +
## scale kick) stands in for recoil/beam-flash/energy-discharge alike across
## Physical/Ranged/Elemental — Support never calls this (Rule 5a: Support
## emits tower_aura_pulse, not tower_attacked; its aura-pulse ring already
## fully covers Support's own ATTACKING-equivalent visual).
