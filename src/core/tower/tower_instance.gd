class_name TowerInstance
extends Node2D

## Minimal visual presentation for a placed tower. Displays a static texture
## keyed by the tower's Foundation archetype (`physical` | `ranged` |
## `elemental` | `support`, per design/gdd/tower.md Group 2).
##
## Scope note: this is presentation only — it has no link yet to
## TowerSystem/TowerMissionState (which remain RefCounted, headless
## simulation with no scene-tree presence). Placement-triggered
## instantiation, tier-based art swaps, and damaged-state visuals are not
## yet designed; call configure() manually until that wiring exists.

## Archetype -> art lookup. All 4 archetypes now have placeholder art.

## Target on-screen height (world units, matches MonsterManager.CELL_SIZE=64
## so a tower reads as roughly one grid cell). Source art is unscaled,
## native ChatGPT-generation resolution and varies wildly by archetype
## (267x471 to 1185x1173, per a project-wide art-asset sweep 2026-08-03) --
## found and fixed proactively here, mirroring the identical unscaled-sprite
## bug already found live (via Godot MCP) and fixed in MonsterInstance and
## diorama.gd's structure sprites. TowerInstance has no live placement
## call-site yet to have caught this by screenshot the same way -- fixed
## ahead of that wiring so it isn't rediscovered the hard way later.

## design/gdd/tower.md IDLE Visual/Audio Requirements: "Elemental towers may
## have a low-intensity particle ambient (embers for fire, frost haze for
## frost) provided it is visually distinct from TARGETING/ATTACKING
## particles." Only these 2 elements are named by the GDD — poison/lightning/
## arcane have no idle-ambient signature specified, so they get none (not an
## oversight; nothing to add without inventing an unspecified signature).
## Deliberately much lower amount/velocity than ProjectileVisual's own
## per-shot trail configs — this must read as "quietly present," not compete
## with TARGETING/ATTACKING visuals per the GDD's own distinctness mandate.
